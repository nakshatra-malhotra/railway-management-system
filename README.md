# RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM üöù
The Railway Reservation System facilitates the passengers to enquire about the trains available on the basis of source and destination, Booking and Cancellation of tickets, enquire about the status of the booked ticket, etc. I have created a CLI (Command Line Interface) based Railway Management System by integrating python with SQL using the module pymysql.
